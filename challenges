In this page I am going to add challenge which I/we faced during our recent project
1. Workspace migration

We are using databricks in our project and earlier we were usign shared workspace where multiple tenant were using that workspace based on some domain tag we used 
to identify cost occured for particular tenant is this and so and so.
But some time it is not good pratice and we decided to use our own workspace.
DevOps created new workspace for us and now we need to migrate all stuffs from old to new workspace.
In Our project mostly external tables used so data stored in ADLS is not an issue.
